\section{Anticipated Significance of the Work}
The merits of this proposed research can be reflected by an anticipated significant contribution to the concept of smart forestry, especially the UAV-based forest firefighting. It is an essential work to improve the wildfire detection and location accuracy  with UAV during the early fire period. The main idea of this work is to save the limited computational resource on-board and decrease the false positive in wildfire discovering stage.
The results of the proposed work would be published in journal and conference publications. Some preliminary results of the proposed research have been presented  in the following conference:
