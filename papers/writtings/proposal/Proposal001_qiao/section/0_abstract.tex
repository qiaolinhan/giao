\begin{abstract}
With the support of specific sensors, it is possible for unmanned aerial vehicle to be conveniently applied in wildfire detection, fire front tracking and prediction tasks. With the encouragement of deep neural network (DNN) technologies, this research focused on image processing and vision-based algorithms to design and develop a mixed air-ground wildfire discovering and monitoring system to support the early wildfire fighting. The proposal report of this research first provide the overview of the related works of this research, and stated the challenges. The detailed strategies to deploy the schemes are outlined after the description of objectives of this research. In specific, they are: DNN-based wildfire detection schemes on-board and on ground work station, DNN enhanced wildfire prediction, filtering-based scheme of wildfire tracking and additionally, DNN-based wildfire image restoration. Finally, parts of these schemes are verified and demonstrated by a series of simulation and experiment.
