# YOLO object detection using OpenCV with Python

https://youtu.be/h56M5iUVgGs

YOLO came out in 2016.  
It is a deep learning algorithm and the algorithm to work needs a framework (Darknet...).  
There are three most used and known frameworks compatible with YOLO:  

| Names| Discriptions| Advantages| Disadvantages|
|---|---|---|---| 
| Darkenet| The framework built from the developer of YOLO| Fast, Work-able on CPU and GPU| Only works with Linux, OS|
| Darkflow| The adaptation of darknet to Tensorflow| Fast, Work-able on CPU and GPU, Compatible with Linux, Windows, MacOS| Complex installation, especially on Windows|
| OpenCV| A framework works with YOLO| works without needing to install anything except opencv| Only works with CPU, so can not get really high speed to process videos.|
