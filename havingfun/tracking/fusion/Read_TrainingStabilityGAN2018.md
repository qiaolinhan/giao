# Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks  
--------------------------
nutshell consecutively reveal density variational persisting 
--------------------------
Propose a novel weight normalization tech called spectral normalization to stablize the training of the discriminator.

* A persisting challenge in the training of GAN is the performance control of the discriminator.
